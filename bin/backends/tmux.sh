# bin/backends/tmux.sh - the tmux session-provider adapter.
#
# Reference backend (AGENTS.md section 8; data/fm-backend-design-d7). P1 moves
# the tmux command sequences that fm-send.sh, fm-peek.sh, fm-watch.sh,
# fm-spawn.sh, and fm-teardown.sh already ran inline into named functions
# here, running the EXACT same commands in the EXACT same order, so the
# default (tmux, `backend=` absent) path stays byte-identical. Sourced only
# through bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_source, never directly.
#
# Worktree acquisition (running `treehouse get` inside the pane, and polling
# its cwd) is unchanged by this extraction: P1 scopes only the session
# provider, not the worktree provider, so fm-spawn.sh still drives that part
# inline with these same send/current-path primitives.
#
# The verified composer/busy-detection and verify-and-retry-submit primitives
# already live in bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh, shared with the away-mode daemon
# (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh); this adapter sources that file and re-exports
# its submit core under the backend's naming convention rather than
# duplicating it, so the two consumers cannot drift apart.

#     new window: the captain's tmux may rename the window away from fm-<id> once
#     treehouse cd's into the worktree, which would break name-based targeting.

# This is the foreground-process-group half of the liveness probe, and it exists
# because `#{pane_current_command}` and `ps -o comm=` expose different name
# fields whose roles vary by platform. On macOS the tmux field can carry a
# harness-rewritten title (Claude Code 2.1.220 reports `2.1.220`) while `comm`
# retains executable identity; the portable Linux regression observes the
# reverse for its version-named executable. Reading both `comm` and argv[0]
# preserves an identifying install path without making either platform's field
# assignment load-bearing.
#
# Scoping to the foreground process group rather than to the pane's descendants
# is what keeps the probe honest in the other direction: a harness-named process
# left running in the background of an otherwise idle pane is deliberately NOT
# reported, so a genuinely agent-free pane still classifies `dead`. It also
# reports every member of a multi-process launcher (the Pi Launcher path runs a
# `pi-signed` wrapper and a `pi` engine in one group), so no launcher needs its
# own special case here.
#
# Like fm_backend_tmux_current_command this is a RAW pane read: tmux answers an
# absent target from the client's active window rather than failing, so callers

# fm_backend_tmux_target_exists: does <target> name a tmux endpoint that really
# exists? The cheap presence half of the liveness contract owned by
# bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_target_exists.
#
# The exit code of `display-message -t <target>` answers nothing. tmux resolves
# an absent target to the current client's own window and still exits 0 - the
# same trap bin/fm-spawn.sh's treehouse-get wait documents ("the window id
# never lies") - so reading that exit code reports every target alive,
# including a window that exists nowhere and a session that no longer exists.
#
# What the command reports is still usable, because tmux names what it actually
# resolved to. So ask for the resolved endpoint's identities and require one to
# equal the target that was asked for. That contains the fallback (an absent
# target resolves to some OTHER endpoint, whose identity cannot equal the one
# requested) without reimplementing tmux's selector rules, so every target form
# firstmate uses keeps working: a `%pane-id` from `$TMUX_PANE`, a `@window-id`,
# the `session:index` supervisor-pane default, `session:name`, and a bare name.
#
# The enumeration deliberately stops there. It does NOT carry the pane-qualified
# `session:index.pane` and `session:name.pane` forms, because tmux splits a
# target at its LAST dot and firstmate window names may contain dots
# (bin/fm-backend.sh's task-id charset permits `.`, and this repo's own
# fixtures use names like `2.1.221`). Composing `#{session_name}:#{window_name}.#{pane_index}`
# would therefore let a recorded target `sess:fm-7.0` be satisfied by a
# DIFFERENT live endpoint - window `fm-7` pane 0 - after the window actually
# recorded as `fm-7.0` is gone, which is exactly the false-alive this function
# exists to eliminate. `sess:A.B` is genuinely ambiguous between a window named
# `A.B` and window `A` pane `B`, and every caller of this primitive judges a
# RECORDED endpoint, where the window-name reading is the only one that can be
# meant. The pane reading is reachable only through
# fm_backend_tmux_supervisor_target_exists below.
#
# A target that does not match falls through to a literal window inventory,
# which is the same evidence fm_backend_tmux_agent_state requires. That second
# read exists because tmux selectors are not exact: `=name` reads a
# digit-shaped window name as an index and reports a LIVE window absent, and a
# false absence is what licenses relaunching onto live work. Neither read can
# invent presence - one compares resolved identity, the other compares recorded
# text - so consulting both only ever recovers a true endpoint.

#
# It answers a different question than fm_backend_tmux_target_exists above, which
# is why it is a separate entry point rather than a flag on the shared one.
# For a recorded endpoint the question is "is the exact window I recorded still
# there", so the ambiguous `sess:A.B` must read as the window NAMED `A.B` and a
# pane-qualified match would be a false alive. For FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET the
# question is "will tmux resolve what the operator typed to a real endpoint this
# daemon can drive", and docs/configuration.md documents that variable as an
# unrestricted tmux target - so a pane-qualified form the strict enumeration
# omits must not read absent, because fm-supervise-daemon.sh turns a false
# absent into a hard startup exit.
#
# Only the operator-typed reading is added, and only after the strict primitive
# has already declined: presence is still established by comparing the identity
